          <h2>Warranties</h2>
          <p>
            It is important to note that Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc,
            manufactures very little of what we sell. Warranties are between you
            the purchaser and the manufacture of the products you purchase. We
            will do everything we can to assist you in any and all warranty
            claims including repair/replacement. But the process by which any
            warranty situation is handled is determined by the manufacture and
            not Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. Also, we DO NOT provide any
            assistance with warranty issues arising on merchandise which was
            sold and/or taken outside of the United States. In these situations,
            we will provide contact information for the manufacture and nothing
            more! In any case, all freight charges arising from returns,
            exchanges, service or anything else is the sole responsibility of
            the purchaser.

              <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                  Due to the nature of our products, changes or cancellations to
                  an order can only be accepted the day the order is placed, and
                  may require written notice of such action.<br />
                  <br />
                  However, "rush" or same day shipping of an item per the
                  customers request, is an exception to this policy, and NO
                  changes or cancellations are accepted.<br />
                  <br />
                  Any "authorized" product return is subject to a restocking
                  fee! This amount will range from 20% to as much as 50%,
                  depending on the manufactures policies.<br />
                  <br />
                  In addition, the customer is responsible for all freight
                  charges in both directions. It is your responsibility to ask
                  before ordering a product from us, if that particular item is
                  a "special order" item, and therefore will not be returnable
                  later on if you wish to do so.<br />
                  <br />
                  No returns, which are "authorized", will be accepted after 30
                  days from the shipment date of your product.

              <h3 class="card-header">Refusal of Shipment</h3>
              <div class="card-body">
                <p>
                  If for any reason a buyer decides to refuse delivery of
                  ordered goods. Return shipping charges and re-stocking fees
                  will be withheld from any monies that would be credited back
                  to the buyer.<br />
                  <br />
                  And in the case of "customized" items such as markers with
                  initials, lead garments that have been either monogrammed or
                  made to customers specification, no refund will be issued at
                  all. <br /><br />Pacific Northwest X-Ray highly recommends to
                  international customers that they contact a customs broker in
                  their area and find out before ordering what duties and taxes
                  may be, as we have no control over those fees, and they are
                  the responsibility of the buyer.<br />
                  <br />
                  Also, be aware that some freight carriers charge a brokerage
                  fee on top of the duty and taxes.

                <p>
                  Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. is a retailer of radiology and
                  other medical products to the general public. We sell products
                  to you, delivered with a variety of shipping methods.
                  Normally, on large items this will require you to have a
                  freight dock or forklift.<br />
                  <br />
                  We can arrange for inside delivery to customers who do not
                  have a freight dock or forklift. However, it is the buyers
                  responsibility to discuss any special delivery requirements
                  with your Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. sales representative at
                  the time of order.<br />
                  <br />
                  It is also the buyers responsibility to note any and all
                  damages to the shipping container, i.e. boxes, before signing
                  and accepting your shipment.<br />
                  <br />
                  Otherwise, there may be little if anything we can do to assist
                  in repairing or obtaining a replacement. Many products such as
                  lead apparel require no special assistance to setup and use
                  them.<br />
                  <br />
                  Other items, such as film processors, do require some
                  assembly, setup and technical know-how to make use of them.<br />
                  <br />
                  But in no way do we offer services to help the customer
                  un-crate, assemble or otherwise make use of the products
                  purchased from us. Often times you can find local
                  professionals in your area to assist you in this. We suggest
                  consulting your local yellow pages under "X-Ray Service". But
                  this is the buyers responsibility to acquire and pay for said
                  services.<br />
                  <br />
                  Finally, some items, such as x-ray generators, require certain
                  licenses from several different government entities.<br />
                  <br />
                  This also is the buyers responsibility. Usage of x-ray
                  equipment on live humans without the proper credentials and/or
                  licenses is a serious crime in many countries. By purchasing
                  such products, you are representing to us that you have, or
                  intend to acquire before usage, any and all legal requirements
                  to use said products in your jurisdiction and that you are
                  fully qualified to do so.<br /><br />
                  Further, you agree to fully indemnify and hold blameless
                  Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. against any and all liability
                  arising out of the usage of any products purchased from us at
                  any time.
